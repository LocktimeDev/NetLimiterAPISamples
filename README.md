# NetLimiterAPISamples
How use NetLimiter 4 API samples

 - All samples are **Visual Studio 2017** C# solutions/projects.
 - All samples reference **CoreLibNet.dll** and **NetLimiter.dll** which are in NetLimiter installation directory. If your NetLimiter 4 location differs from `C:\Program Files\Locktime Software\NetLimiter 4`, then you have to change the references. (We will polish this in the future)
 - On **64bit systems** use 64bit build.
